1. Collect more training data
2. Derive other fea, ex: accel, delta time, orientation
3. Preprocess data: scalling, normalization (see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/preprocessing.html)
4. Interpolate missing waypoints, interpret 'NaN', rearange waypoints: missing values aren't always at the end
5. Try another machine learning algorithm ( GradientBoostingRegressor, secondary: GP (GaussianProcess), Lasso, DecisionTreeRegressionwithAdaBoost,)
6. Make a rosnode as a predictor given a trained regressor
	regressor = load_trained_regressor(filepath)
	X = extract_fea()
	y = regressor.predict (X)
